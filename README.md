# Attack, Defense and Network Analysis

This is attack, defence and network anlaysis activity where I performed roles of both a penetration tester, a SOC analyst and a Security Engineer.

As a security engineer I implemented alarms and thresholds in Elasticsearch Watcher. As a penetration tester I found vulnerabilities, gained access and escalated privileges into a vulnerable WordPress server. As a SOC analyst I used Wireshark to analyze network traffic and find malicious activity. I also Suggested system hardening measures and created a report in Microsoft Power Point.

This was a good hands on excercise to gain insight into both offensive and defensive security roles. This included application of knowledge of following skills and tools:

- Penetration testing with Kali Linux.
- Security Engineering with Elasticsearch Watcher.
- User enumeration using WPScan.
- Cracking password hashes using John The Ripper.
- Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark.
- System hardening and configuration.
- Reporting, documentation, and communication.

The project report was created in Microsoft Power Point. PDF version of the report is available ![here](Final_Engagement_Attack_Defense_and_Analysis_of_a_Vulnerable_Network.pdf). The report includes following details:

- Network Topology
- Critical Vulnerabilities
- Exploits Used
- Avoiding Detection
- Alerts Implemented
- System Hardening Recommendations
- Network Traffic Profile
- Normal and Suspicious Activity
